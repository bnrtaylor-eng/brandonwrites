      <h2>How to Revise a Sentence</h2>

      <div class="content">
<p>Revision is often taught as correction—tightening up grammar, eliminating redundancy, fixing what’s broken. But the most important sentence-level revisions aren’t about correctness. They’re about clarity, rhythm, and above all, voice.</p>

<p>One of the best things you can do for your writing is to revise a sentence until it sounds like something only you could have written. This doesn’t mean making it eccentric or ornamental. It means asking: <em>does this sentence carry my emphasis, my cadence, my concern?</em> Voice is where thought meets form.</p>

<p>For example, consider a sentence from a student essay: <em>"Shakespeare uses soliloquies to express Hamlet’s emotions."</em></p>

<p>A first revision might clarify the idea: <em>"In his soliloquies, Hamlet reveals the internal conflict driving his delay."</em></p>

<p>To push further and foreground voice, think about what matters in your interpretation. If you're emphasizing rhetorical function: <em>"Each soliloquy stages a struggle not just with action, but with articulation—Hamlet speaks to think."</em> If you're probing irony or instability: <em>"Even in his most introspective moments, Hamlet performs; the soliloquy becomes theater, not confession."</em></p>

<p>Each version presents a distinct interpretive stance. Revision is the process of finding the sentence that best reflects your perspective on the text—not just stating a claim, but embodying the reading.</p>

<p>In the first chapter of <em>The Truth About Stories</em>, Thomas King writes that “the truth about stories is that that's all we are.” He reminds us that writing isn’t just about delivering information—it's about framing identity, experience, and perspective. That’s why revision isn’t just trimming or rearranging; it's an act of care. When you revise, you’re not just repairing a sentence. You’re finding the version of it that best carries your thinking into the world.</p>

<p>If you're looking for more strategies and models, check out these excellent resources: the <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/style/" target="_blank">UNC Writing Center's guide to style and voice</a>, the <a href="https://writingcommons.org/article/revision-strategies/" target="_blank">Writing Commons' article on revision strategies</a>, and the <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/sentence_variety.html" target="_blank">Purdue OWL's guide to sentence variety</a>. Each offers specific, applicable techniques to help you develop a clearer and more distinctive written voice.</p>

<p>A good sentence doesn't just avoid error. It invites a reader to think with you. That’s the goal.</p>

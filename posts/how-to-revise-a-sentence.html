      <h2>How to Revise a Sentence</h2>
      <p class="date">20 May 2025</p>
      <p class="summary">Some practical strategies for tightening student writing without losing voice.</p>
      <div class="content">
<p>Revision is often taught as correction, such as tightening up grammar, eliminating redundancy, fixing what’s broken. But the most important sentence-level revisions aren’t about correctness. They’re about clarity, rhythm, and above all, voice.</p>

<p>One of the best things you can do for your writing is to revise a sentence until it sounds like something only you could have written. This doesn’t mean making it eccentric or ornamental. It means asking: <em>does this sentence carry my emphasis, my cadence, my concern?</em> Voice is where thought meets form.</p>

<p>When revising a sentence, try asking yourself:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is the core idea clear on first read?</li>
  <li>Does the rhythm reflect the tone I want?</li>
  <li>Am I hiding my argument in abstraction or cliché?</li>
  <li>Would I say this aloud the same way I’ve written it?</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, consider a sentence from a student essay: <em>"Shakespeare uses soliloquies to express Hamlet’s emotions."</em></p>

<p>A first revision might clarify the idea: <em>"In his soliloquies, Hamlet reveals the internal conflict driving his delay."</em></p>

<p>To push further and foreground voice, think about what matters in your interpretation. If you're emphasizing rhetorical function: <em>"Each soliloquy stages a struggle not just with action, but with articulation. Hamlet speaks to think."</em> If you're probing irony or instability: <em>"Even in his most introspective moments, Hamlet performs; the soliloquy becomes theater, not confession."</em></p>

<p>Each version presents a distinct interpretive stance. Revision is the process of finding the sentence that best reflects your perspective on the text—not just stating a claim, but embodying the reading.</p>

<p>Clarity doesn’t mean blandness. The goal isn’t to flatten your style or strip away complexity, but to shape your voice so that its insights and inflections are easy for others to follow.</p>

<p>In the first chapter of <em>The Truth About Stories</em>, Thomas King writes that “the truth about stories is that that's all we are.” Revision often starts with correction: tightening grammar, trimming redundancy, and fixing weak phrasing. But its real value lies in shaping clarity, rhythm, and voice. The strongest sentence-level revisions make your thinking precise and your style unmistakably your own. You’re finding the version of it that best carries your thinking into the world.</p>

<p>Here’s another simple example. Original: <em>"Donne’s sermon is really deep and has a lot of meaning."</em> Revised: <em>"Donne’s sermon layers scriptural authority with corporate metaphor to construct a vision of divine economy."</em> Both point to complexity—but only one makes that complexity legible.</p>

<p>If you're looking for more strategies and models, check out these excellent resources: the <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/style/" target="_blank">UNC Writing Center's guide to style and voice</a>, the <a href="https://writingcommons.org/article/revision-strategies/" target="_blank">Writing Commons' article on revision strategies</a>, and the <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/sentence_variety/" target="_blank">Purdue OWL's guide to sentence variety</a>. Each offers specific, applicable techniques to help you develop a clearer and more distinctive written voice.</p>

<p>A good sentence doesn't just avoid error. It invites a reader to think with you. That’s the goal.</p>

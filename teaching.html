    <h2>Teaching</h2>

    <p>I teach courses in literature, composition, linguistics, and digital editing, with a focus on rhetorical analysis, textual history, and pedagogical clarity. My approach blends close reading with collaborative writing, archival engagement, and digital literacy.</p>

    <h3>Undergraduate Courses Taught</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Freshman Composition</strong> — Critical writing, revision pedagogy, and rhetorical modes including argument, definition, cause/effect, and exemplification.</li>
      <li><strong>Early British Literature</strong> — Survey course exploring texts from the medieval through neoclassical periods, emphasizing historical context, cultural continuity, and the relevance of these works to contemporary questions of power, identity, and belief.</li>
      <li><strong>Early American Literature</strong> — Survey course organized around the question “What is America?”, ranging from Indigenous oral traditions to the 1850s.</li>
      <li><strong>Shakespeare's Drama</strong> — Study of four major plays (<em>Romeo &amp; Juliet</em>, <em>Twelfth Night</em>, <em>Henry IV Part One</em>, and <em>King Lear</em>) with an emphasis on performance-based analysis and group scene work as a method of literary engagement.</li>
      <li><strong>Grammar & Linguistics</strong> — Introduction to phonology, morphology, and syntax using <em>Essentials of Linguistics</em> (Anderson).</li>
      <li><strong>World Mythology</strong> — Comparative readings from global creation stories and epics, emphasizing myth as cultural memory and transmission.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Integrating literary analysis with historical and rhetorical context.</li>
      <li>Designing multimodal and collaborative assignments.</li>
      <li>Building classroom discussion around critical questions and close textual work.</li>
      <li>Incorporating digital tools (GitHub, TEI, Netlify) into student projects.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Workshops in Development</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Writing 101 Bootcamp</strong> — A short-format workshop, taught cooperatively, introducing foundational writing strategies, argument structure, and revision techniques for undergraduate students across disciplines.</li>
      <li><strong>TEI Encoding for Digital Scholarship</strong> — A multi-phase workshop designed to train student contributors in the editorial and technical practices of TEI-XML encoding for the <a href="https://earlymodernletters.org" target="_blank">Early Modern Letters</a> project, with a focus on Chamberlain’s correspondence and digital annotation methods.</li>

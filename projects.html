    <h2>Digital Projects</h2>

    <p>My digital scholarship focuses on the design, editing, and curation of early modern materials, particularly through open-access platforms and collaborative annotation. I approach digital work not as a secondary output but as a mode of scholarly inquiry and pedagogy.</p>

    <h3>Early Modern Letters</h3>
    <p>I am the founding editor of <a href="https://earlymodernletters.org" target="_blank">Early Modern Letters</a>, a TEI-based digital edition of the correspondence of John Chamberlain. The project aims to provide a fully encoded, annotated, and publicly accessible corpus of over 240 letters from McClureâ€™s 1939 edition. It is designed as both a research resource and an editorial lab for collaborative student contributions.</p>

    <h3>TEI Workflows and Editorial Pedagogy</h3>
    <p>As part of the editorial infrastructure for Early Modern Letters, I have developed standardized TEI templates, contributor guides, and workflows for XML markup, version control, and digital publication. These tools are designed to support accurate, sustainable encoding and to offer students meaningful participation in scholarly editing.</p>

    <h3>GitHub and Netlify Deployment</h3>
    <p>The entire project is managed using GitHub and deployed through Netlify, enabling a static, fast-loading, and easily maintained site architecture. This workflow makes the project both reproducible and transparent, offering a model for future small-scale digital humanities sites.</p>

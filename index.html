      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am an Assistant Professor of English at Mount Marty University and Editor-in-Chief of <a href="https://earlymodernletters.org" target="_blank">Early Modern Letters</a>. My work examines how early modern literature engages questions of institutional power, political theology, and corporate form, with a focus on figures like John Donne, Aphra Behn, and William Shakespeare.</p>

      <h2>Research Ethos</h2>
      <p>I study how literary form articulates and contests institutional power, focusing on political theology, corporate identity, and collective life. My work explores the kinds of communities literature envisions, alongside the forms of power it renders intelligible.</p>
